// Uses of JavaScript
// JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages because of its wide range of applications.

// Before JavaScript was primarily used in:

// making web pages interactive
// Nowadays, JavaScript is also used in:

// server-side applications
// game development
// mobile apps
// web apps
// Now let's explore the uses of JavaScript in more detail.

// 1. Making The Web Pages Interactive
// JavaScript is used to make the web pages interact with the user with various functionalities such as

// Form validation such as checking if an email format is correct or not
// Displaying a countdown clock
// Interactive maps
// Creating cool animations
// Different actions on the press of the button
// Use of dropdown menu
// There are many other ways where JavaScript is used in making the web pages interactive.


// 2. Making Server Side Applications
// JavaScript is also used as a server-side language to build back-end development using node.js (a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 engine).

// The Node.js provides an environment for JavaScript to run on servers.

// Before JavaScript was only used for making the web pages interactive. However, the use of JavaScript node.js is accepted as a good option for back-end development as well.


// Companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber, Trello, PayPal, NASA, eBay, Medium use node.js to power their applications.

// 3. Creating Interactive Front-End Pages
// One of the growing uses of JS nowadays is creating super interactive front-end applications. For this, the commonly used JavaScript frameworks are React, Vue and Angular.

// These applications load the resources as soon as the website is loaded which results in fast and responsive user interaction with great user experience.

// Some examples of single-page applications are Facebook, Google Maps, Gmail, Twitter, etc.

// Various JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React, MeteorJs, BackboneJs, EmberJs, PolymerJs, KnockoutJs, Aurelia could be used as the front-end technology to build interactive front end pages.

// Two popular frameworks used for front-end application development are Angular and React.

// Note: Angular is developed by Google and React is developed by Facebook. Hence, we can expect good and long support for this framework.

// 4. Creating Mobile Applications
// JavaScript is also used in making Android and iOS apps. React Native is a popular framework built on JavaScript for this purpose.

// One thing that is particularly interesting about React Native is that we can create both Android and iOS apps from the same codebase. This helps in:

// faster development time
// easy to develop
// cost effective
// Some of the popular applications developed in react native are Facebook Ads, Walmart, Bloomberg, Instagram, Gyroscope, AirBnB, Myntra, UberEats, Discord, Townske, and many more.

// Note: React Native is developed by Facebook. Hence, we can expect good and long support for this framework.

// 5. Game Development
// JavaScript is also used for game development.

// Various JavaScript libraries such as Three.js, TweenMax could be used to create browser games.

// Other popular JS gaming engines and libraries are GDevelop, melonJS, ImpactJS, BabylonJS, PhaserJS, PixiJS, PlayCanvas, A-Frame.

// Some libraries even allow you to export your games into other platforms such as Android, iOS, etc.
